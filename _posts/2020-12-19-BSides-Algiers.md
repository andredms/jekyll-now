subtitle: Forensics writeup

BSides Algiers came to a close late last night, and although having slightly harder challenges than what I’ve done before they were a great learning experience. This writeup will be focussing on the forensics category and the challenge "It’s Complicated My Pal". 

My team for this CTF was 0xTBD and myself and @Pix worked on this particular solution together.
